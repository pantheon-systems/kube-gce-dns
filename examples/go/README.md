## Introduction

This is a Go project skeleton that provides detailed documentation in the form of comments.

It's intended to be primarily used as documentation, but could theoretically be copied and modified as needed. You should probably remove the comments, especially from the Makefiles, as they're echoed back to the terminal otherwise.

If you're a complete beginner, start reading `circle.yml` and then proceed to `Makefile` and onwards.
